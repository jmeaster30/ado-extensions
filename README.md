# ADO Extensions

These are extensions that I have needed for Azure DevOps

## version-counter
An automated version number counter task that modifies version numbers in variable groups.

I needed this because I had a version number in a build pipeline that I needed in the release pipeline so it was inside of a variable group. However, I only wanted to update the version number after a certain stage in the release pipeline.

TODO - Add in some usage of the task
